# Algorithmic Trading Strategies Implementation

*Currently Work In Progress - Just wanted to Initiate*

Algorithmic trading, often referred to as algo-trading or black-box trading, is the use of computer algorithms and mathematical models to execute trades at high speeds. It's a way of making trading decisions based on predefined criteria without human intervention. These strategies can range from simple moving average crossovers to complex statistical arbitrage techniques.

The benefits of algorithmic trading include:
- **Speed**: Algorithms can process and act on market data much faster than humans.
- **Consistency**: Algorithms always follow the strategy's rules, ensuring consistent trading decisions.
- **Emotionless**: Removing human emotions from trading can help in making more rational decisions.
- **Efficiency**: Algos can watch multiple markets or securities simultaneously, ensuring opportunities are never missed.

The aim of this repository is to implement and understand various algorithmic trading strategies. Each strategy will be thoroughly explained and then implemented in code.

## Implemented Strategies

| Strategy Name | Description | Link to Implementation |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Moving Average Crossover | A strategy that buys/sells when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average. | [Link](#) |
| ...           | ...         | ...                    |

(Note: This table will be updated as more strategies are implemented.)
